# RGraphicsDevice
A custom report item for SQL Server Reporting Services to add R plots to reports.

This is a "backup" of a CodePlex project I started a few years ago. Meanwhile there may be much better options to do R plots in Reporting Services but if you still need to use older versions of SQL Server, this may still be useful for you.

Feel free to use but code and documentation is provided "as is". Although I am a Microsoft employee, this is not an official Microsoft product.

See the contained Manual.docx for more infos.
